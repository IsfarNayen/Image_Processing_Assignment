# Image Processing Steps

This repository contains an image processing notebook designed for Kaggle. The notebook demonstrates how to load, process, and save images using OpenCV and PIL (Pillow) in a Kaggle environment.

<h2>Features </h2>

- Load and display images in Kaggle
- Convert images to black and white (grayscale)
- Save processed images in the Kaggle working directory

<h2>Steps</h2>

- **Install Dependencies**

    Kaggle notebooks come pre-installed with necessary libraries, but if running locally, install them using:
    ```python
    pip install opencv-python pillow matplotlib
    ```
- **Clone the Repository**
  ```python
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing-kaggle.git
    cd image-processing-kaggle
  ```

- **Run the Notebook**
    - Upload the notebook to Kaggle Notebooks and run it.
    - Alternatively, run locally using Jupyter:
    ```python
        jupyter notebook image-processing-kaggle.ipynb
    ```
